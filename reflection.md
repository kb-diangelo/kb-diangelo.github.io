* What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

This exercise really reinforced for me the difference between padding and margin. I was able to recall that *padding* is *the space between your content and the border* and margin is *the space between your element and other elements/the edge of the page*. The *border* sits in between, invisibly, denoting the edge of your content. While I understood all this before I was really able to put it ito play by experiementing with the yellow and blue colored boxes on my site.

* What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned the *float: left;* and *float: right;*, while good and useful, may not have been the best choices for positioning things that you want to be closer together than at the very edges of the page. I used floats for my picture and some links to my social media and then added margins so they weren't at the extreme of the page but it might have been a better choice to leave floating for things you DO want at the extreme edge of the page. I didn't have time to experiement with other positioning layouts.

* What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

My wireframe was so simple that it was not very difficult to get things approximately where I wanted them. The hardest part was making design choices, by far. I AM NOT a designer and this aspect of this challenge was very frustrating.

* What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned/had reinforced that dividing elements properly using <div>s, <section>s, <aside>s etc is very important. Thinking of each element as a box with its own padding, border, and margin, was also important.
