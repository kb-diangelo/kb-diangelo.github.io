  <h2> Arrays and Hashes</h2>
  <h4>11/16/2015</h4>
    <p>
      This week at DBC, we learned about two really important Ruby data structures: arrays and hashes. These structures are similar in a few ways but there is a critical difference in how you access values in an array vs. in a hash. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Arrays</strong> are basically ordered lists of information. An array contains a collection of values - which can be any object: integers, strings, other arrays, booleans, etc - all of which have an index that represents their place in the array. These indices start at 0, not 1, as is typical in the computer world. So you can imagine an array as an ordered list of items, starting at 0. 
    </p>
      You can create an array in a few ways. The first is to use the constructor <em>Array.new</em>...

      <div class="code">
        my_array = Array.new()
      </div>
      ... which will create a new, empty array. You can add items to the array either by pushing them to the array using << or .push, which will add them to the end of the array ...
      <div class="code">
        my_array.push("first item")<br>
        my_array << "second item"
      </div>
      which will, for example, add the strings "first item" and "second item" to the empty array we created in index 0 and 1, respectively, or by specifying what index they should be at ...
      <div class="code">
        my_array[2] = "third item" <br>
        my_array[3] = "fourth item"
      </div>
      which will, in this example, add the strings "third item" and "fourth item" to the array we created in index 2 and 3, respectively. We could have even done that in the opposite order, it would have been fine.
    </p>
    <p>You can also create an array by using literal notation. You can initialize the array either as an empty array and then add items just like we did when we used the constructor, or add the values when you make the array, seperated by commas.
      <div class = "code">
        my_array = [] #creates an empty array<br>
        my_array << "first item"<br>
        my_array << "second item"<br>
        my_array << "third item"<br>
        my_array << "fourth item"<br>
      </div>
      or
      <div class="code">
        my_array = ["first item", "second item", "third item", "fourth item"]
      </div>
    <p>To access the items in an array, we refer to them by their index. For example ... 
      <div class="code">
        my_variable = my_array[3]
      </div>
      would assign the value stored in the 3rd index of my_array (the string "fourth item") to my_variable.
    </p>
    <p>To iterate over an array, that is, to do something for every value contained in the array, we can use the .each method. The syntax for this is a little more complicated than we've seen before. We need .each and a block bracketed by either <em>do</em>/<em>end</em> or the curly brackets {} to tell Ruby what we're doing for each of these items in the array. We also need a placeholder value bracketed by || (whatever that character is called), to be, as Chris Pine puts it, "the variable that each will use to point to the objects in the array" (<em>Learn to Program 2nd Edition</em> Ch. 8). 
      <div class ="code">
        my_array.each do |value|<br>
          puts value<br>
        end
      </div>
      The code above, therefore, will iterate over all the values in my_array and <em>puts</em> each one to the console.
    </p>
    <p>A <strong>hash</strong> is similar to an array in that it is a list of values but instead of these values having <em>indices</em> they have what are known as <em>keys</em>. A key is a value associated with the value stored in the hash. It can technically be any object, but the most common keys are strings and symbols.
    </p>
    <p>Like an array, a hash can either be created with a constructor, in this case <em>Hash.new()</em> or literally.
      <div class="code">
        # using a constructor<br>
        my_hash = Hash.new()<br>
        my_hash["favorite animal"] = "axolotl"<br>
        my_hash[:favorite_food] = "beets"<br>
        <br>
        # using literal notation <br>
        # there are a couple ways to do this </br>
        # if your keys are symbols you can put the : <br>
        # at the end of the symbol instead of the front: <br>
        my_hash = {favorite_animal: "axolotl", favorite_food: "beets"}<br>
        # if your keys are strings, other values, symbols, or a mix, <br>
        # you can use the "hash rocket"<br>
        my_hash = {:favorite_animal => "axolotl", "favorite food" => "beets"}<br>
        # you can also add these values one at a time <br>
        # like we did in the above example<br>
      </div>
    <p> To iterate over a hash, you can use <em>.each</em> with two placeholder values in the ||, one for the key and one for the value. Alternatively, if you want to iterate over just keys or just values you can use the <em>.each_key</em> or <em>.each_value</em> methods respectively.
    </p>
    <p> So why would you use one or the other? Arrays are good when you just need a list of items. Hashes are good when you want to associate a key with a value. To use the example of my favorite things, we could make a array of my favorites: "axolotl", "beets", and so on, but this array probably wouldn't make much sense. When we are storing information that needs some context, ie, a key, a hash is a better choice.

    I hope you didn't notice that this blog post got less and less thorough and organized as it went on! Technically this assignment was supposed to take an hour but I am kind of a slow writer and I've already spent over two on it. Well, I hope you enjoyed reading about what I learned at DBC this week!</p>
