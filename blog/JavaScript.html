  <h2 class="blue_round">JavaScript Constructor Functions vs. Ruby Classes</h2>

  <h4>12/07/2015</h4>
    <p>
      Last week we went pretty in depth about <a href="ruby-classes.html">Ruby classes</a> but as we are learning more and more about JavaScript, we're going to touch on something that's sort of an equivalent (but not really) to creating a class in Ruby: JavaScript <em>constructor functions</em>. 
    </p>
    <p>Recall: "In Ruby, a class is like a bundle of related methods (behaviors) and properties that are shared between different instances of that class (different instances of that object)." In JavaScript, constructor functions also lay out a blueprint for creating objects, but what the word "object" means in both languages is very different!</p>
    <p>A Ruby object is anything. Like, anything. Everything is Ruby is considered an object and ultimately belongs to the <em>Object</em> class. A JavaScript object, on the other hand, is a particular kind of data structure, not completely dissimilar from a Ruby hash, in which value are stored under names (properties) of that object and then referred back to with dot notation. An example:</p>
    <div class = code>
    var maxolotl = {<br>
    species: "Ambystoma mexicanum",<br>
    name: "Maxolotl",<br>
    age: 5,<br>
    color: "leucistic",<br>
    cute: true, <br>
    bump: function(){console.log("Bump!")}<br>
  }<br>
  <br>
console.log(maxolotl.name); <br>
console.log(maxolotl.age); <br>
maxolotl.bump(); <br>
</div>
<p>
... this would print "Ambystoma mexicanum", 5, and "Bump!" to the console.</p>
<p>
  So now that we understand what an object is in JavaScript, how can we create lots of similar objects easily? The way to to do this is to create a function that constructs these objects given arguments about what the particular properties of the object are. Constructor functions look pretty similar to normal functions in JavaScript; there's no special notation that describes them as constructors. The only thing that is different from every other JavaScript function is the use of this.<em>property</em> = <em>argument or value</em> to set the properties of the objects to be constructed, and the convention that their names should be capitalized. So let's look at an Axolotl constructor.
</p>
<div class = "code">
function Axolotl(name, age, color) {<br>
  this.name = name;<br>
  this.age = age;<br>
  this.color = color;<br>
  // and some things that are true for all axolotls<br>
  this.cute = true;<br>
  this.species = "Ambystoma mexicanum";<br>
  this.bump = function(){console.log("Bump!")}<br>
}<br>
<br>
var max = new Axolotl("Maxolotl", 5, "leucistic");<br>
var billy = new Axolotl("Billy Bob", 1, "wildtype");<br>
</div>
<p>
  Now we have two Axolotl objects that share certain traits (the bump function, being cute, being "Ambystoma mexicanum") while varying based on the input given (name, age, and color). Notice that we use the <strong>new</strong> keyword to create them.
</p>
<p> So what are the key differences between Ruby classes and JavaScript constructor functions, besides the syntax? Well, like I said before, a Ruby class can define any kind of new object, but a JavaScript constructor can only create a new instance of the "object" data structure. There is also a matter of inheritance. Ruby classes can inherit from other classes, and be nested into one another, but constructor functions (AS I HAVE DESCRIBED THEM HERE) cannot (there may be other ways to inherit in JavaScript that I haven't learned about yet!). Also, in Ruby, if you want the ability to read/write to the properties of an instance of a class, you have to include that when you define the class (with <em>attr_reader</em>, <em>attr_writer</em>, and <em>attr_accessor</em>). In JavaScript, you can always(?) access the properties of an object built with a constructor using dot notation.
