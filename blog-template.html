<!-- 
* How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

I'm going to be honest, wireframing with a pair did not feel constructive. We were both kind of sketching out designs separately and then showed each other but it was hard to give any constructive comments on the wireframe, because I (and my pair) have no design experience. It felt like something that might have been better served as an individual activity. As for writing HTML, having a pair to remind me of all the semantic elements that I should be using in my page was useful. That part of the exercise felt constructive.

* Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I am not really sure. I can see how it would be important to us when we are a little more advanced as to making websites look the way they should. But for now it felt like an exercise in futility when we created something we couldn't possibly implement. But it was somewhat useful in that it gave me a basic idea of what to work off of.

* What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

My pair and I decided that the best wireframe was basic and something to work off of. Both our wireframes were rather "aspirational" though as they included formatting we couldn't possibly implement with our level of knowledge.

* What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

My pair reminded me of the <nav> element for navigational bars. I also made sure to include <head>, <header>, <body>, and <footer> which I learned about in Codecademy.
