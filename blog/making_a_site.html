  <h1>Week 9</h1>
  <h2>My Webiste</h2>
  <h4>12/21/2015</h4>

  <p>This week we were supposed to retool our websites a little bit to make them more "professional". Well I still don't have a good picture of myself so I'm keeping my MS paint portrait up on the index page for now. Maybe one day I WILL invest in a professional photographer to make me look dyanamic and competetant. For now it will have to do.</p>
  <p>If you've been following my site you probably don't notice much difference between last week and this week. I've gotten pretty attached to my little site design and I didn't want to make any major changes. I'm far from a designer so if someone was to tell me yellow was a bad choice well... I don't know what I would say.It's my favorite color, after all! I did make a few changes "under the hood", especially as to the blog pages, that won't make any difference to the viewer but which makes my pages more consistent and hopefully more readable by assistive technologies. </p>
  <p> The process of making a website has obviously taught me a lot about HTML and CSS as well as made me think about what kinds of ways I want to present myself to the world. It's going to continue to be a work in progress.</p>
