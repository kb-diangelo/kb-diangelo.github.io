		I am K. B. (or KB, "Kaybi") DiAngelo and I am a student in the Chorus Frogs 2016 cohort at DevBootCamp. My goal is to make the most of this program and come out of it a (hopefully employable!) junior web developer. Before I joined DBC I was a horticulturist with a firm based in Westchester, NY specializing in commercial/office interiorscape and holiday. While I loved working with plants I knew I was going to have to make a radical change if I wanted to achieve my career goals. My educational background is in biology and women's, gender, and sexuality studies, which I studied at Williams College (class of 2012). I currently live and study in beautiful New York City. My hobbies include fussing about with my microscope, reading feminist critiques of Taylor Swift videos, hiking, fishing, and tabletop gaming.
